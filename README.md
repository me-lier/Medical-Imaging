## Introduction

Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial in the treatment of medical conditions. This project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze medical images and provide diagnostic assistance for pneumonia, brain tumors, and skin infections. 

## Features

- **Pneumonia Detection**: Analyzes chest X-ray images to detect signs of pneumonia.
- **Brain Tumor Prediction**: Processes MRI scans to identify and predict brain tumors.
- **Skin Infection Detection**: Uses dermatological images to detect various skin infections.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps and other visual aids to highlight areas of concern in medical images.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/me-lier/Medical-Imaging.git
   cd medical-imaging-analysis
## Datasets
      Pneumonia Detection: Chest X-ray dataset
      Brain Tumor Prediction: Brain MRI dataset
      Skin Infection Detection: Acne dataset
      Model Architecture
The models are built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with architectures tailored for each specific task. Detailed descriptions of the models and their architectures can be found in the respective Python scripts.
